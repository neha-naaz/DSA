You have been given a text message. You have to return the Run-length Encoding of the given message.
Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive
characters as the character and a single count. For example, the string "aaaabbbccdaa" would be encoded as "a4b3c2d1a2".

Sample Input 1 :
3
aabbc
abcd
abbdcaas
Sample Output 1 :
a2b2c1
a1b1c1d1
a1b2d1c1a2s1
Explaination For Sample Input 1:
Test Case 1: As 2 consecutive 'a', 2 consecutive 'b', and 1 'c' are present in the given string so output is "a2b2c1".

Test Case 2: As 1 consecutive 'a', 1 consecutive 'b', 1 consecutive 'c' and 1 consecutive 'd' are present in the given
string so output is "a1b1c1d1".

Test Case 3: As 1 consecutive 'a', 2 consecutive 'b', 1 consecutive 'd', 1consecutive 'c', 2 consecutive 'a' and 1
consecutive 's' are present in the given string so output is "a1b2d1c1a2s1".

Sample Input 2:
2
sadasd
adsad
Sample Output 2:
s1a1d1a1s1d1
a1d1s1a1d1
